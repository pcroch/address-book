## III. HOW TO

    * CRUD actions on both controllers to be described *

## IV. Testing description
mvn -Dtest=AcademyTest test

I tried here to have a 100% coverage for the testing

**A- HOW TO**

*It will launch all the Unit testing and Integration testing*

      Run: mvn clean test

*To run a specific test class*
For example: PersonRepositoryTest

      mvn -Dtest=PersonRepositoryTest test

*To run a specific test caes in a class*
For example: test_save_person_repository method in PersonRepositoryTest

      mvn -Dtest=PersonRepositoryTest#test_save_person_repository test

**B- Jacoco Analysis**

When runninng mvn test, it will create html reports with a full analysis of the testing.
you can find that reports in: 

      address-book/target/site/jacoco

Not that the purpose of that app is to reach a 95% test corevage
